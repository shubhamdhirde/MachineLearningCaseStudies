# MachineLearningCaseStudies  
This is my first machine learning case study based on Iris flower dataset in scikit-learn library from python  
In this application I removed one entry from each label of iris dataset and train with the remaining entries.  
• Apply predictions based on Decision tree with that removed entries.  
• Plot the decision tree using pydot library.  
  
•Classifier : Decision Tree  
•DataSet : Iris Dataset  
•Features : Sepal Width, Sepal Length, Petal Width, Petal Length  
•Labels : Versicolor, Setosa , Virginica  
•Training Dataset : 147 Entries  
•Testing Dataset : 3 Entries
